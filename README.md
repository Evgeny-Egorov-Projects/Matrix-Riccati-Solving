# Matrix-Riccati-Solving

A set of functions intended for solving differential matrix Ricati equations. Was developed in order to perform quasiclassical calculations describing superconducting system. Functions provide solution along the  quasiclassical trajectory of a quasiparticle.
Parallelization should be implemented on a level higher than the library functions, as solution along the trajectory depends on the previous steps.
